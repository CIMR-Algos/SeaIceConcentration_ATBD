# CIMR L2 SIC, SIE, and SIC1H ATBD

This document describes the algorithm theoretical basis for three closely related CIMR Level-2 products:
1. the nominal Sea Ice Concentration (SIC) Level-2 product ({term}`SIC3H`);
2. the nominal Sea Ice Edge (SIE) Level-2 product ({term}`SIE`);
3. the Sea Ice Concentration (SIC) Level-2 product with {term}`Near Real Time 1H` latency requirement.

At this stage, these three products are documented in a single document because they share a large
fraction of justification, approach, and software prototype code. For example, the SIE product is
derived from the SIC product. This can be reconsidered at a later stage.
